Hi,

As an experienced Web Designer with over 25 years of expertise, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team. I have a solid background in designing, developing, and maintaining digital assets to deliver a cohesive and functional brand identity. My experience spans websites, mini websites, deliverables, web apps, landing pages, emailing, and more, enabling me to help you achieve your online requirements.

With strong proficiency in hand-coding HTML and CSS, I prioritize web standards, accessibility, and web semantics. My solid understanding of UX/UI principles, inspired by Jared Spool and Jakob Nielsen, ensures that I create user-friendly and effective designs. I am also familiar with integrating rich web applications such as Content Management Systems, Enterprise Resource Planning, Ecommerce, and Mailing.

I invite you to visit my portfolio to see examples of my work, including data displays, wireframing, prototyping, landing pages, emailing, websites, and prints. My portfolio showcases my commitment to web standards, usability, and accessibility.

Share with me one project you're most proud of.
I was Design Chief at a Mexican StartUp called SocialDecode. We did social TV Ratings and build a system to track social interactions with TV Shows.

I was in charge of designing all the digital assets which included: Websites, Custom Dashboards feeded by our API, Landin Pages, Email Campaigns, Infographics, client deliverables and Mobile Apps.

Altough the StartUp went bankruptcy there's still information on the web and you can see some of my work in my online portfolio.
